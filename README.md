Description
Write a paragraph summary of the current status of your project, what you hope to achieve during the intensive, how and why

I want to create website where users can post and discuss wagers they have placed. 

Challenges I Anticipate
List out the challenges you anticipate for completing this project

Skateboard
ONE SINGLE aspect of product. Consider: build backend for SPD 1.2 front end, CRUD one resource, use API or library, authentication etc.
Users should have the ability to post bets (posts) and comments on a certain wager. I would also like to add the ability where users can filter by team, and by author.

Start coding and finish “Skateboard” feature before beginning “Bike”.

Bike
ONE additional features that get you closer to your idealized product. Examples: CRUD 2nd resource, add comments, API use, authentication, library use
improve user interface

Car
ONE additional feature

implementing api to retrieve real-time NBA scores.

Personal Achievement Goals:
Each teammate must achieve 2 of 3 of their self-set personal achievement goals. If you're not on a team, delete the other teammate sections as needed.

Teammate 1
Goal 1: Skateboard
